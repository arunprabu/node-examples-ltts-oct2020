WebRTC 
====
    WebRTC - Real Time Communication Standard
    HTML5 Standard for browsers to communicate between them 
    Browsers can communicate in real time with other browser 

    WebRTC has some building blocks for developers to use to build apps 
    The apps can do video chat over internet 
    WebRTC works on supported browser. 
    And It doesn't require any other additional tools. 

    Along with HTML5, a JavaScript API is introduced for WebRTC 
    The JS API enables developers to develop WebRTC based webapps 
    It connects directly to the browser without any storage needed in between. 
    So, essentially it is a peer to peer connection 
    (similar to a chrome to another firefox)

    Signalling Server 

    In a nutshell, WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers 
    and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) 
    capabilities via simple APIâ€™s.

    We need a front end. So let's build one in pug 

Websockets 
====
    Communication between browser and a server 
    One way is HTTP; another is websocket 

    WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, 
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a 
    single TCP connection.

    WebSocket is a bi-directional communication between 
    the server and the client which implies that 
    both parties can communicate and exchange data at the same time.

    Allows real-time data flow b/w both client and server 

    Socket.io -- an implementation of websockets concept in JS (usable in both NodeJS and Front end) 
    To build this app: 
    Refer: https://socket.io/docs/ and https://socket.io

    Example app is here https://socket.io/demos/chat/
