SinonJS
====
SinonJS provides stand alone test spies, stubs and mocks.
This is the mechanism we'll be using to create our spies, stubs and mocks.

Spies: 
----
Creates fake functions which we can use to track executions. 
This means we can tell/ find out whether the function has been 
executed/ how many times its been called etc. 
We can also use spies on existing functions and get the same capability, 
to track those functions executions. We'll see this in action a bit later.

Stubs: 
-----
Enables us to replace functions. This gives us more control. 
We can return whatever we want or have our functions work in a way 
that suites us to be able to test multiple scenarios.

Mocks: 
-----
They are fake methods, that have pre-programmed behavior and 
pre-programmed expectations.
